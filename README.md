# notes-app
cool notes app built with vanilla js but structured like React, no styling yet

You can do some cool things to see how it works across multiple browser screens.  If you right click a new note, and have it 
in a separate window, I have used the window storage event to allow realtime updating across, which can be seen by changing the 
title note browser window, you will see that it is changing in the main note app interface.

I also have it using local storage for saving, so if you always use the app in the same browser, chrome for example, it notes will
always appear as you left them after closing and reopening the app.

The filter option also renders changes as you type in an input as well as the sort feature.
